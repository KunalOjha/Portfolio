                        newest apps using the latest and
                        greatest technologies!</p>
                    <p>I pride myself in my ambition to take on new projects and welcome current and future tasks with
                        an
                        end
                        goal of satisfying client requirements, building lasting professional relationships, and
                        growing as
                        a
                        developer for years to come.</p>
                    <p>I truly believe the marks of a good developer is one who is a continuous learner and adapts to
                        the
                        high
                        paced demands of our exuberant growth rate in technology and frameworks. It starts with having
                        a
                        thorough understanding of the core Javascript, HTML, and CSS libraries, and continuously adding
                        to
                        that
                        proverbial toolbelt in order to deliver optimal code without compromising quality and time. </p>
